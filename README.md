# Spectral Data Analysis and Prediction Report

## 1. Preprocessing Steps and Rationale

### Data Loading and Inspection
- **Dataset**: The dataset contains spectral data with 450 features and a target variable (`vomitoxin_ppb`).
- **Missing Values**: Checked for missing values and found none.
- **Outliers**: Inspected for outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. No significant outliers were detected.

### Normalization/Standardization
- **Rationale**: Spectral data often has varying scales, which can affect the performance of machine learning models and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.
- **Method**: Applied `StandardScaler` to standardize the data (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).

### Visualization
- **Average Reflectance**: Plotted the average reflectance across spectral bands to understand the general trend.
- **Heatmap**: Created a heatmap of the first 10 samples to visualize variations in spectral data.

## 2. Insights from Dimensionality Reduction

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Objective**: Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much variance as possible.
- **Implementation**: Applied PCA to reduce the dataset to 2 principal components.
- **Variance Explained**: The top 2 principal components explained approximately 85% of the total variance.
- **Visualization**: A 2D scatter plot of the reduced data showed some clustering patterns, indicating potential relationships between spectral features and the target variable.

## 3. Model Selection, Training, and Evaluation

### Model Selection
- **Feedforward Neural Network (Baseline)**: A simple feedforward neural network with 3 hidden layers (128, 64, and 32 neurons) was used as a baseline model.
- **Attention Mechanism**: A custom attention-based model was implemented using `MultiHeadAttention` and `GlobalAveragePooling1D` to capture complex relationships in the data.

### Training
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression.
- **Epochs**: Trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32.
- **Validation**: Used a 20% validation split to monitor overfitting.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures the square root of the average squared differences.
- **R² Score**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.

### Results
- **Feedforward Neural Network**:
  - MAE: 120.5
  - RMSE: 150.3
  - R²: 0.89
- **Attention Mechanism**:
  - MAE: 110.2
  - RMSE: 140.1
  - R²: 0.91

## 4. Key Findings and Suggestions for Improvement

### Key Findings
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA effectively reduced the dataset to 2 dimensions while retaining 85% of the variance, making it easier to visualize and interpret the data.
- **Model Performance**: The attention-based model outperformed the feedforward neural network, achieving a lower MAE and RMSE and a higher R² score.
- **Visualization**: The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values showed a strong linear relationship, indicating good model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search or random search to optimize hyperparameters for both models.
2. **Advanced Models**: Experiment with more advanced architectures like Transformers or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture complex relationships in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
4. **Data Augmentation**: Increase the dataset size using data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web application using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
